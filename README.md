# Analysis of the Frobenius Metric on Kuramoto Networks

## Overview
This project investigates the variation of the **Frobenius Metric** across different types of neural networks (SBM, ER, BA) based on threshold t values and different coupling constants (0.3, 0.5, 0.8). The goal is to verify the effectiveness of the **SVISE** and the **SINDy** methods on networks with different topologies.

### Frobenius Metric Graphs
Below are the graphs of the Frobenius Metric for each coupling constant K. Each graph includes all network types (SBM, ER, BA).

#### 1. Coupling Constant \( K = 0.3 \)

# Analysis of the RMS Metric on Kuramoto Networks

## Discussion


## Conclusion
The results indicate that the effect of the coupling constant could cause the Frobenius norm to vary but there is no clear evidence for a preference towards a topology among SBM, BA or ER while the RGR performed worse than the other 3.
